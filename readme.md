# Lua Lapis

## NOTES

First attempt at trying Lapis

[Lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis/)

I am on an M1 MAC and struggled to get a working version locally with luarocks.

Ended up using a docker image to get lapis to work

## REQUIREMENTS

- docker
- docker-compose

## BASIC USAGE

from root run:
`docker-compose up --build`

go to `localhost:9090`
